# Getting and cleaning data project 

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
In this case the data set is collected from the accelerometers from the 
Samsung Galaxy S smartphone (the UCI HAR dataset). A full description of this
dataset can be found here:

[Description](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) - archive.ics.uce.edu

This link also contains a download link for the dataset itself.

A short description (from the README file accompanying the dataset) is included below

## Procedure

The following steps were taken to complete the assignment.

1. Download the UCI HAR Dataset file 
2. Unzip the data set into the chosen working directory
3. Load test and training datasets into the respective test/training data frames
4. Load the source variable names for test and training data sets
5. Load the activity labels
6. Combine the test and training data frames using rbind
7. Pair down the data frames to include the mean and standard deviation variables
8. Replace the activity IDs with the activity labels to render readability
9. Combine the Test and Training data frames to produce one data frame containing the subjects,    measurements and activities. 
10. Arrive at the merged data set text file with the combined data frame as the first expected output (total.csv)
11. Create one more data set using the data.table library of R thereby grouping the tidy data by subject and activity
12. Apply the mean calculations across all the groups
13. Arrive at the final calculated tidy data text file as the final required output to complete the assignment (average.csv)

The R script that executes these steps is run_analysis.R. This script contains 
extra comments.

Finally, codebooks were generated of the resulting files from steps 10 and 13 above.
(codebook_total.Rmd and .pdf and codebook_averages.Rmd and .pdf)

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
